# Devanagari_plagiarism_detector
In the context of Nepal's journalistic and academic landscape, the absence of dedicated plagiarism detection tools poses a significant challenge to maintaining the authenticity of textual content. This research introduces a Web Application for Devanagari Plagiarism Checker, strategically designed to address the unique linguistic characteristics of Nepali content within news articles and documents. Departing from traditional algorithms, the methodology adopts an innovative shingle-based analysis facilitated by Apache Solr's custom configuration. The project's motivation stems from the pressing need to fill this critical gap in the realm of Devanagari plagiarism detection.

This project was aimed as a learning experience and as a stepping stone to help solve the larger problem of plagiarism in Devanagari scripts
